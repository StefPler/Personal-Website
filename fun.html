                            The red panda is dwarfed by the black-and-white giant that shares its name. These pandas
                            typically grow to the size of a house cat, though their big, bushy tails add an
                            additional
                            18 inches.

                            The pandas use their ringed tails as wraparound blankets in the chilly

                        The red panda shares the giant panda's rainy, high-altitude forest habitat, but has a wider
                        range. Red pandas live in the mountains of Nepal and northern Myanmar (Burma), as well as in
                        central China.

                        These animals spend most of their lives in trees and even sleep aloft. When foraging, they
                        are
                        most active at night as well as in the gloaming hours of dusk and dawn.

                        Red pandas have a taste for bamboo but, unlike their larger relatives, they eat many other
                        foods
                        as well—fruit, acorns, roots, and eggs. Like giant pandas, they have an extended wrist bone
                        that
                        functions almost like a thumb and greatly aids their grip.

                        They are shy and solitary except when mating. Females give birth in the spring and summer,
                        typically to one to four young. Young red pandas remain in their nests for about 90 days,
                        during
                        which time their mother cares for them. (Males take little or no interest in their
                        offspring.)

                        The red panda has given scientists taxonomic fits. It has been classified as a relative of
                        the
                        giant panda, and also of the raccoon, with which it shares a ringed tail. Currently, red
                        pandas
                        are considered members of their own unique family—the Ailuridae.

                        Red pandas are an at-risk species, victims of deforestation. Their natural space is
                        shrinking as
                        more and more forests are destroyed by logging and the spread of agriculture.
